          <p>Recent feedback has suggested that some families would like to have the option to pay for a room where their partner could also stay overnight with them when their baby is born.
This facility (often called amenity rooms) is available in most maternity units around the country in other NHS organisations. We have listened to that feedback and the Woodland Rooms at Jessop Wing is the culmination of that feedback.</p>

              <p>It is not possible to book a room in advance of the birth because your clinical condition and that of your baby will need to be assessed before a decision is made as to your suitability</p>
              <p>However, once your suitability has been assessed your midwife will be able to let you know if a room is available for you to use.</p>

              <h3 class="question">How long can I stay?</h3>
              <p>Your stay will be expected to be overnight only. You will need to check out of the room by 2pm on the following day.</p>

              <h3 class="question">How much does it cost?</h3>
              <p>A Woodland Room costs £150 per night. You will need to pay for the room prior to occupying it. For your convenience there is a card machine to enable you to pay by either credit or debit card at the 24 hour reception in the Labour Ward once your suitability has been assessed. Cash cannot be taken. If clinical circumstances mean that your stay in hospital is for more than one night you will have to move to the normal ward as you and your baby need to be medically fit to remain in these rooms.</p>

              <h3 class="question">How will my birth experience impact on my suitability for a Woodland Room?</h3>
              <p>If you give birth by caesarean section or have experienced any complications either prior to, during, or following the birth of your baby you will need to be cared for in the ward area. This will also include if your baby requires any specific treatment or observations. Ask your midwife about your suitability to use a private room when you have given birth.</p>

              <p>Your partner will be offered breakfast in the room, and can access the tea and coffee making facilities. There is a coffee shop within the Jessop Wing for all other meals and snacks which your partner might want to purchase.</p>

              <p>We are sorry but other children cannot stay overnight in a Woodland Room. However, your children can visit you in the Room. If your partner is staying with you, please make arrangements for them to leave with a responsible adult at the end of vising time.</p>

              <p>As you would expect your partner will need to wear appropriate clothes while staying in the Woodland Rooms, as staff will need to care for you during your stay and will be coming into the Rooms to do so. Please make sure you both bring in appropriate comfortable clothing.</p>
